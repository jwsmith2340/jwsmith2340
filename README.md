Hello there, I’m James Smith, a software engineer with a passion for solving problems. I am skilled in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Express, Node, and MongoDB. I am constantly learning new skills and practicing the ones I already know. I believe that a person should never stop learning, and I live my life according to that belief. I have extensive experience working in teams in dynamic operations as a member, a leader, and a supervisor. I am a driven, focused, and hard-working individual, and I’d love to have a conversation about how I could work with you to achieve your organization's goals.
