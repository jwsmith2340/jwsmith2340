- 👋 Hi, I’m @jwsmith2340
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full-stack web developer. I was a firefighter prior to enrolling in General Assembly's Software Engineering
immersive course, so this is a big left turn for me. However, I have spent much of the past three years working toward an electrical engineering
degree, so I feel great about going into a fast paced academic setting. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals! Everyone has to start somewhere, and while I've had a LITTLE coding experience in college, I'm
definitely not yet proficient in web development skills. However, I'm a big believer in paving the road you want to walk with hard work, so
I'm looking forward to the challenges ahead. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything! More specifically, however, I am a guitarist that is having a really hard time finding
other musicians to jam with, so I would absolutely love to contribute to any type of 'meet up' apps or webpages for musicians.
- 📫 How to reach me: The easiest way is to send me an email at jwsmith2340@yahoo.com
