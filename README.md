I am a software engineer currently working at Cigna on a data engineering team. My current project is building an Airflow instance deployed with GitHub, Ansible, and Jenkins onto Red Hat Enterprise Linux VMs, the purpose of which is to replace a legacy ETL system that feeds an InfluxDB time series database. 

I write a lot of Python to interface with various systems, including Dynatrace, New Relic, Zabbix, and many others that provides data to feed our enterprise command center dashboards. I pride myself on writing performant, maintainable, and efficient code that delivers business value.

A few of the main technologies I work with are Python, Airflow, Redis, Openshift, Kubernetes, Docker, and Grafana, but I tend to get my hands on a lot of different tech. 

I'm interested in contributing to open source software and am currently writing a PR for the Apache Airflow open source project. If you're interested in learning more about what I do or are interested in discussing some similar technologies, feel free to send me a message. I'm always interested in growing my network.
